class _ProjectTree(QtWidgets.QTreeWidget):
    """Project tree that expands/collapses a project on a *single* click
    anywhere on its row -- not only on the small branch arrow.

    Toggles via ``setExpanded`` directly -- the exact call QTreeView's own
    arrow hit-test makes internally -- instead of retargeting the click onto
    the arrow and replaying it through QTreeView. That retargeting used to
    hit QTreeView's itemDecorationAt() branch, which handles the arrow click
    and returns *without* calling QAbstractItemView's mousePressEvent, so
    Qt's internal pressedIndex bookkeeping never updated, and a later real
    double-click on the row got silently downgraded back into a plain press
    -- no project switch, even though the row could still look selected.

    The toggle itself is deferred rather than run inline: with animation on
    (setAnimated(True)), calling setExpanded() synchronously *inside*
    mousePressEvent also corrupts that same pressedIndex bookkeeping for the
    row just pressed, breaking doubleClicked on it -- even with the unmodified
    event passed straight to QTreeView. Deferring lets the whole press/release
    sequence for this event finish first, so the expand animation can never
    land inside the same window Qt uses to validate a double-click.

    That deferral is also why the row click used to expand with a snap while
    the arrow expanded smoothly. QTreeView drives the drop-down off the view's
    State: expand() puts the view in AnimatingState and paintEvent only
    composites the before/after pixmaps while it stays there. The deferred
    toggle runs between the press and the release, so the animation is already
    under way when QAbstractItemView::mouseReleaseEvent fires -- and that
    unconditionally calls setState(NoState), dropping the view out of
    AnimatingState one frame in. The native arrow click never hits it, because
    QTreeView::mouseReleaseEvent sees the click on the decoration and skips the
    base-class release entirely.

    So the release restores the state the base class clobbered, instead of the
    toggle being moved after the release. Moving it there does keep the
    animation, but it lands the expand inside the window Qt uses to validate a
    double-click, and project switching (doubleClicked -> openProject) stops
    working. Re-arming AnimatingState touches nothing else: pressedIndex and
    the rest of the double-click bookkeeping are left exactly as the
    unmodified base class left them, and the animation's own completion
    handler still returns the view to NoState when it finishes.

    Re-arming it does mean the view is now in AnimatingState for the ~250ms
    the drop-down takes -- and the second click of a double-click lands inside
    that window. QTreeView::mouseDoubleClickEvent begins with a bare
    ``if (state() != NoState) return;``, so it would swallow the click and no
    project would open. mouseDoubleClickEvent below steps over that guard: an
    animation still in flight is not a reason to ignore a double-click, and
    the animation settles on its own either way (it did before this class
    existed, since the release used to end it every time)."""
