; =============================================================================
; eSim Windows installer (Inno Setup 6).
;
; Compiled by build-windows.ps1, which passes:
;   /DAppVersion=<VERSION>   /DStageDir=<staged tree>   /DOutDir=<dist>
;
; Design notes (see PACKAGING.md for the full rationale):
;  * Install root defaults to C:\FOSSEE\eSim -- deliberately SPACE-FREE:
;    the optional MSYS2/mingw toolchain (NgVeri model builds) and ngspice
;    code-model paths break subtly under paths with spaces.
;  * Everything per-user (~/.esim, ~/.nghdl, KiCad sym-lib-table) is done by
;    windows\windows_bootstrap.py on every launch, NOT here -- so multi-user
;    machines and upgrades self-heal, and the logic is unit-tested.
;  * KiCad IS bundled, at tools\kicad: the official installer's payload,
;    pruned for eSim by build-windows.ps1's Stage-Kicad (no 3D models/demos/
;    translations). Private to eSim: esim.bat prepends tools\kicad\bin to
;    PATH; no registry entries, file associations or global env vars, so a
;    system-wide KiCad install coexists untouched. One exe = the whole tool.

; License agreement page. eSim is GPLv3; the repo's root LICENSE is the same
; text shipped in the install tree. Pointing LicenseFile at it makes Inno add
; the standard "License Agreement" page (accept/decline) before folder select,
; matching the old NSIS installer's first step. Path is relative to this .iss.
; Inno reads it as plain text (no .txt extension needed; RTF is auto-detected).
LicenseFile=..\LICENSE

; Branding. One identity end to end: the setup exe carries the SAME icon as
; eSim.exe, the Start-menu/desktop shortcuts and the uninstall entry, so the
; downloaded file is recognisable in Explorer and the download bar before it
; is ever run. The wizard panels (eSim mark + FOSSEE logo) are generated from
; the repo's own logo assets by branding\make-wizard-images.py -- one file per
; DPI scaling step (100/125/150/200%); Inno picks the closest match, which is
; why they are listed rather than wildcarded (a wildcard would also sweep the
; small images into the big-panel slot).

[Dirs]
; eSim's HDL model builds WRITE inside the install tree by design -- exactly
; like the Ubuntu install owns $HOME/nghdl-simulator. Setup runs as admin but
; eSim runs as the user, so the written dirs carry a users-modify ACE, which
; NTFS inheritance then extends to everything [Files] installs into them
; (Inno processes [Dirs] before [Files]).
;
; The grant used to sit on {app} itself. That also handed every local user
; write access to python\, eSim.exe, tools\kicad\bin and tools\msys64\ -- i.e.
; the ability to swap a binary the NEXT user of the machine runs. On the
; shared lab machines eSim targets that is a local tamper vector, so the ACE
; is scoped to the two trees the running app genuinely writes:
;
;   tools\nghdl            new model sources land in src\xspice\icm, the .cm
;                          rebuild runs in release\, `make install` writes
;                          install_dir\, and windows_bootstrap.fix_spinit
;                          rewrites install_dir\share\ngspice\scripts\spinit
;                          on first launch (it ships with build-machine paths
;                          baked into its codemodel lines).
;   library\modelParamXML  createkicad / createkicadCosim / NgVeri /
;                          model_teardown add and remove <model>.xml under
;                          Ngveri, NgVeriCosim and Nghdl.
;
; Read-only at runtime -- verified against the source, deliberately NOT
; granted (if a future change starts writing to one of these, widen the list
; here rather than moving the ACE back up to {app}):
;   library\kicadLibrary   static symbol libs are referenced in place; the
;                          libs eSim REWRITES moved to ~\.esim\kicad_symbols
;                          (kicad_symlib.generated_symlib_path) long ago, and
;                          the install path survives only as a legacy READ
;                          probe for migrating older installs.
;   library\bin\iverilog   ensure_unversioned_libvvp() copies libvvp.dll only
;                          when the build did not -- and Stage-SimToolchain
;                          stages it (the Bleyer fallback has no libvvp to
;                          copy at all, so the write never happens either way).
;   tools\msys64           used purely as a toolchain: mingw32-make, gcc,
;                          verilator and ghdl are invoked by full path with
;                          cwd= the model dir, and the generated cfunc's
;                          scratch file goes to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp.
;   src, windows, python   bytecode is precompiled by [Run] below, as admin.
;
; KNOWN RESIDUAL -- this scoping removes eSim's OWN over-broad grant, and on
; its own it does NOT finish the job at the default install root. Windows
; ships C:\ with `NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(OI)(CI)(IO)(M)`, an
; inherit-only Modify that propagates into every folder created under it, so a
; tree at {sd}\FOSSEE\eSim inherits user-writable ACLs from the drive root no
; matter what this section says. Verified on a real install:
;   C:\FOSSEE\eSim\python -> BUILTIN\Users:(I)(OI)(CI)(M)      [this section]
;                            NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users:(I)(M)  [from C:\]
; Closing it needs the install root's INHERITANCE broken as well, e.g. a [Run]
; step after the files land:
;   icacls "{app}" /inheritance:r ^
;     /grant *S-1-5-32-544:(OI)(CI)F /grant *S-1-5-18:(OI)(CI)F ^
;     /grant *S-1-5-32-545:(OI)(CI)RX
; (well-known SIDs, not names -- localized Windows renames these groups). That
; is a bigger behavioural change than a permissions narrowing: it must be
; validated by a Full install followed by an NgVeri + d_cosim + NGHDL model
; build from a SECOND, standard-user account, since getting it wrong leaves a
; tree the user can neither build in nor delete. Deliberately left for that
; test rather than shipped unverified.

[Files]
; Core = everything except the HDL build toolchain. NOTE tools\nghdl\
; install_dir (the custom eSim ngspice runtime: d_cosim + ivlng + ghdl.cm,
; plus ngspice_gui.exe, the wingui twin that draws the interactive plots)
; IS core -- every flavour simulates with it; only the trees used to BUILD
; new HDL models (MSYS2, ngspice sources, configured build tree) are the
; optional 'hdl' component. release_gui is a throwaway build dir; the build
; script deletes it, and this excludes an interrupted build's leftovers.
; tools\nghdl.old: a hand-made backup of an earlier simulator tree that
; survives in the stage across incremental builds (nothing in the pipeline
; creates or purges it) and rode into the last release as 127 MB of dead
; weight. Belt and braces -- the build script now deletes it as well.
;
; Ship-size excludes (the stage keeps all of this -- source rebuilds there
; need the full toolchain; only the SHIPPED tree is trimmed):
;  * tools\nghdl\{examples,tests,autom4te.cache,visualc,man}: ngspice source
;    tarball baggage; runtime model builds touch only src\ headers, release\
;    and install_dir\.
;  * tools\ngspice\{examples,docs}: official-zip baggage, ~26 MB.
;  * pip/pytest and friends: installed into the stage python for build-time
;    testing; the app imports none of them. NOTE the installed tree therefore
;    has no pip/pytest -- run the suite against an install with the STAGE
;    python (same version, same wheel set).
;  * scipy: nothing in the tree imports it (also gone from
;    requirements-windows.txt; this catches stages provisioned before that).
;  * developer/repo files a user install has no use for (leading backslash =
;    rooted at {app}, so e.g. \scripts does NOT touch python\Scripts, and
;    \docs does not shadow anything deeper):
;      - build/porting notes + packaging docs (WINDOWS-*.md, PACKAGING.md,
;        MAINTAINERS-PACKAGING.md), contributor/repo docs (CONTRIBUTION.md,
;        SECURITY.md, INSTALL -- Ubuntu instructions), Sphinx sources
;        (\code, \conf.py, \index.rst), Linux-only trees (\ihp, \patches,
;        \scripts, \docs, make-release.sh), and pip metadata for the bundled
;        interpreter (setup.py, requirements.txt, python-wheels.lock).
;      - unrooted `tests`: every dir named tests outside msys64 is dev-only
;        (src\*\tests, site-packages numpy/matplotlib/colorama tests, kicad
;        stdlib tests) -- verified by find before adding. `test` likewise
;        (kicad stdlib ctypes/tkinter/unittest test dirs). msys64 and the
;        nghdl src/release trees have their OWN [Files] entries, so these
;        unrooted patterns cannot reach the toolchain.
;    windows\windows_bootstrap.py STAYS: launcher_windows imports it on
;    every launch. README.md, LICENSE, VERSION, RELEASE stay (user-facing).

;  * gdb (debugger; nothing in a user install debugs). NOTE: this exclusion
;    used to be paired with "mingw64's python3.14 deliberately STAYS despite
;    arriving as gdb's scripting dep", because verilator's verilated.mk
;    hardcodes `PYTHON3 = python3` and every NgVeri model make runs
;    $(PYTHON3) verilator_includer -- pruning it broke NgVeri with "Error
;    127". That reasoning silently depended on gdb being INSTALLED, and gdb
;    has never been in $MingwPkgs: it was only ever present in a
;    hand-provisioned build tree ("Install Reason: Explicitly installed"),
;    so the python it dragged in vanished the moment anyone built from
;    scratch -- and NgVeri died with `python3: command not found` again.
;    ModelGeneration now passes eSim's OWN bundled interpreter as a make
;    command-line variable (_python_for_make), so no MSYS2 python is needed
;    on any path and nothing here has to be kept alive for it. Do not
;    "restore" mingw-w64-x86_64-python to fix a python3 error; check that
;    override instead.
;  * gnat*.exe + adainclude: the Ada COMPILER that built ghdl. ghdl.exe is
;    statically linked (imports only system DLLs) and never compiles Ada at

;    elaboration, so NGHDL links against it on user machines.
;  * autotools (autoconf x6, automake x8, aclocal): configure ran at package
;    time; runtime model builds only ever run make. perl STAYS -- the

; launch. esim.bat remains in {app} for terminal use (--no-console, --doctor).
; AppUserModelID matches SetCurrentProcessExplicitAppUserModelID in

; the taskbar shows the eSim icon (and pinning works) instead of a blank
; python entry.

;

; =============================================================================
; [Code] -- what the uninstall log alone cannot clean.
;
; Inno removes exactly what it installed. eSim adds to that tree AFTER the
; install log is written, so a plain uninstall used to leave the install
; folder standing with hundreds of files in it:
;
;   * __pycache__: the [Run] compileall above, plus every later launch,
;     writes .pyc for modules whose stage counterpart had none (windows\,
;     parts of python\Lib) -- unlogged, so never deleted.
;   * Examples\: simulating a bundled example writes beside it --
;     <name>.cir.out, analysis, plot_data_*.txt, *.raw, *_Previous_Values.xml,
;     <name>-cache.lib, -rescue.lib.
;   * library\SubcircuitLibrary, library\deviceModelLibrary: subcircuits and
;     device models the user adds land in the install tree.
;   * tools\nghdl, tools\kicad, library\modelParamXML: covered above.
;
; and per-user state the installer never created and cannot see:
;
;   * ~\.esim, ~\.nghdl (windows_bootstrap.py writes these on every launch)
;   * %APPDATA%\kicad\<ver>\sym-lib-table rows whose uri points INTO the tree
;     being deleted -- left behind, KiCad reports a missing library on every
;     schematic the user opens afterwards.
;
; So the uninstall gains two steps:
;   usUninstall     -- ask about the user's own data, then run
;                      windows\uninstall_cleanup.py while the bundled python
;                      is still on disk (nothing has been deleted yet).
;   usPostUninstall -- SweepDir removes whatever the log playback left, i.e.
;                      every file eSim wrote after installation, and a
;                      detached cmd takes the emptied folders afterwards.
;
; Safety: the sweep is a recursive delete of a user-chosen directory, so it
; runs only when {app} still carries an eSim marker file AND is not a system
; directory or a drive root AND this user's workspace is not inside it (a
; workspace under the install tree cancels the sweep outright -- leftover
; files are a nuisance, deleted schematics are not recoverable). Directory
; reparse points (junctions/symlinks) are unlinked, never followed. If
; anything is refused (eSim or KiCad still running, files open in a terminal)
; the user is told which folder to remove by hand rather than being left to
; discover it.
