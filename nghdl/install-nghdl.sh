#   DESCRIPTION: Unified installer for NGHDL — the eSim custom ngspice
#                (nghdl-simulator) plus GHDL, Verilator and Icarus Verilog
#                (with libvvp, for d_cosim), for Ubuntu 24.04 / 25.x / 26.04.
#                (22.04 is unsupported: apt ships Verilator 4 + KiCad 6, too old
#                 for the current PyQt6 / Verilator-5 / KiCad-9 application.)
#
#                ONE script, version-aware via detect_profile(). Replaces the
#                old per-version install-nghdl-scripts/install-nghdl-XX.04.sh set.
#
#                Key design:
#                - GHDL + Verilator come from apt (no source builds). apt
#                  verilator is >= 5 on all supported releases, and ghdl-llvm
#                  (or the gcc backend) is available.
#                - Icarus Verilog is built from source with --enable-libvvp:
#                  ngspice's ivlng adapter dlopens libvvp at run time and apt
#                  iverilog ships WITHOUT it. Source-built (not a committed
#                  binary) so it tracks the distro toolchain and stays ABI-
#                  matched to the nghdl-simulator. Non-fatal: on failure we fall
#                  back to apt iverilog (Verilog Verifier still works; only
#                  d_cosim is lost). See library/cosim/INSTALL_SUBSTRATE.md.
#                - Both the nghdl-simulator (custom ngspice) and Icarus Verilog
#                  are built from source; everything else comes from apt.
#                - GHDL MUST use the llvm or gcc backend, NEVER mcode: nghdl
#                  links its VHDL socket server with `ghdl -e -Wl,...`, which
#                  mcode rejects -> server never builds -> "Simulation Failed".
#                  See GHDL-BACKEND-26.04.md in install-nghdl-scripts/.

# Apply every simulator patch shipped beside this script to the extracted
# tree. Two layouts carry the same patches and both must work: a standalone
# NGHDL checkout keeps them next to the tarball they patch (patches/ngspice),
# and inside an eSim tree NGHDL sits in nghdl/, one level below eSim's own
# patches/ngspice. First layout that exists wins.
# Idempotent: a patch that is already applied is detected with a reverse dry
# run and skipped, so re-running the installer over a patched tree is a no-op.
# Missing patch directory is not an error (a source drop may not carry one);
# a patch that neither applies nor is already applied IS an error, because
# silently building an unpatched simulator is how a fixed bug comes back.
